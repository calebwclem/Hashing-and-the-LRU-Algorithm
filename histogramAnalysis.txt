1) After compaction, the histogram has a lot more counts within the smaller bins.
Nearly 300 bins post compaction are 1-2 counts while before compaction there were a mere 17 bins that were 1-2 run counts.

2) Before compaction, the histogram was alot more evenly distributed with most of the bin sizes being larger
, and is much more evenly distributed than post-compaction, the historgram is very skewed to the left (smaller bin counts).
In fact, post compaction there are only 22 counts in the bins > 17.

3) The average run length is 25% after compaction as compared to before.
Per the chart, the average run length was 20.02. After compaction, the average run length was merely 4.96.
The median follows similarly, with a precompaction median of 12 and a postcompaction median of 4.

4) Post compaction, we have alot more runs than before. However, the average run is so much shorter that it
is both reasonable and prudent (Even median run length is 1/3 the previous length post-compaction).

5) Per the observation in 3, the median run lengths actually shows that there are a lot more outliers in the data
before compaction. Therefore, by performing compaction, we dramatically reduce the number of outliers. We notice this
through the precompaction median of 12 vs the mean of 20.02.

6) Precompaction and postcompaction also shows a significant difference in the rate of the largest runs.
P90: Precompaction: 10% have a run value of 44 or more. Postcompaction: 10% have a run value of 11 or more.
P95: Precompaction: 5% have a run legnth of 66 or more. Postcompaction: 5% have a run length of 14 or more.

This shows that the top end of runs is significantly reduced post compaction, increasing efficiency.

7) The total runs counted precompaction was 242. After compaction the total runs was 825. This makes
more efficient for probing because our run ends alot earlier (allowing us to probe fewer bins).
